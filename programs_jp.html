			<div id="abstract_Washio" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p style="text-indent:1em">In this lecture, we propose an algorithm that optimizes the ventricular fiber structure of the human heart.
			A number of histological studies and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging analyses have revealed that the myocardial fiber forms a right-handed helix at the endocardium.
			However, the fiber formation changes its orientation as a function of transmural depth, becoming a left-handed helix at the epicardium.
			To determine how nature can construct such a structure, which obtains surprising pumping performance, we introduce macroscopic modeling of the branching structure of cardiac myocytes in our finite element ventricular model, and utilize this in an optimization process.
			We put a set of multidirectional fibers around a central fiber orientation at each point of the ventricle walls, and simulate heartbeats by generating contraction forces along each of these directions.
			We examine two optimization processes using the workloads or impulses measured in these directions to update the central fiber orientation.
			Both processes improve the pumping performance towards an optimal value within several tens of heartbeats, starting from an almost-flat fiber orientation.
			However, compared with the workload optimization, the impulse optimization produces better agreement with experimental studies on transmural changes of fiber helix angle, streamline patterns of characteristic helical structures, and temporal changes in strain.
			Furthermore, the impulse optimization is robust under geometrical changes of the heart, and tends to homogenize various mechanical factors such as the stretch and stretch-rate along the fiber orientation, the contraction force, and energy consumption.</p>

			<div id="abstract_Mas" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p style="text-indent:1em">Iterative methods are a way to compute the least squares solution of a big overdetermined system of linear equations, especially when the coefficient matrix is also sparse. The use of a good preconditioner can speed up the convergence of the method, and in some cases, their use is necessary to get convergence. We propose to compute the preconditioner using a variant of the Balanced Incomplete Factorization algorithm that is breakdown free when the coefficient matrix has full rank. This preconditioner computes an incomplete LU factorization of the coefficient matrix of the normal equations using a criterion to annihilate entries based on the (incomplete) LU factorization of the inverse of the coefficient matrix.</p>
			<p style="text-indent:1em">We also discuss ways to update a given preconditioner using the same framework. If a set of new equations is added to the system or, on the contrary, a set of equation is deleted. This strategy permits to construct a new preconditioner from the previous one, in a way that is cheaper than to recalculate a preconditioner from the scratch.</p>
			<p style="text-indent:1em">We also present the results of the proposed methods on several test problems to assess their performance.</p>

The first one is localization of defects or localized current anomalies in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) from the magnetic flux density measured around the PEFCs. After analyzing the physical properties of the singular values and vectors, imaging approaches with Tikhonov and L1 norm regularization methods are compared. Then we propose a complex analysis based method in which multiple pointwise current anomalies can be identified directly and algebraically from the measured magnetic flux density. The second subject is identification of the electrical conductivity and permittivity inside the human body from the magnetic field measured by using a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner.</p>

			Since CG may not converge for inconsistent systems, we use MINRES.
			We will use right preconditioning for MINRES, since it is easier to preserve the equivalence of the problem especially for the inconsistent case.
			In this talk, we first introduce the algorithm for the right preconditioned MINRES and analyze the convergence of this method for singular systems theoretically.
			Then we propose the right preconditioned MINRES using Eisenstat SSOR.
			Some numerical experiments indicate that the right preconditioned MINRES using Eisenstat SSOR is more efficient and robust compared to right scaling preconditioned and MINRES without preconditioning for some problems.
			Finally, we show that the residual norm can be further reduced by restarting the method.</p>

A new normwise condition number for the TLS problem is introduced and SVD-based explicit formulae for the TLS condition number are derived. Our proposed condition estimation algorithms are efficient for the small and medium size TLS problem. Numerical examples illustrate the reliability of the algorithms.

			<div id="abstract_Sogabe" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close">
			<p style="text-indent:1em">Complex symmetric (not Hermitian) linear systems arise in a rich variety of applications such as　condensed matter physics, electromagnetics, and acoustics. One of the best-known Krylov subspace　methods is the COCG (conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient) method of van der Vorst and　Melissen in 1990.
			Since the COCG method has irregular convergence behavior, the QMR-SYM　method was proposed by Freund in 1992.
			In 2007, we focused on the CR (conjugate residual)　method, and extended it to complex symmetric linear systems with short term recurrences relations.
			The resulting algorithm, referred to as the COCR method, is easy to implement as well as the COCG　method, and tends to have smooth convergence behavior as well as the QMR-SYM method if the　coefficient matrix is close to real symmetric.</p>
			<p style="text-indent:1em">In this talk, we give a brief overview of Krylov subspace methods for complex symmetric linear　systems, and a recent progress of the COCG method in a direction of (generalized) shifted linear　systems with multiple right-hand sides that also arise in condensed matter physics.
			In addition, I　would like to talk about Professor Hayami’s interesting lecture on numerical analysis at the
University of Tokyo when I was a graduate student.</p>

			<div id="abstract_Aihara" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p style="text-indent:1em">The Bi-Conjugate Gradient (Bi-CG) method and the Bi-Conjugate Residual (Bi-CR) method are the basic short-recurrence iterative methods for solving nonsymmetric linear systems. In finite precision arithmetic, the oscillation in the residual norms of the Bi-CG type methods is known to affect the convergence speed and the ultimately attainable accuracy of the approximate solutions. For reducing the influence of rounding errors, it has been proposed that the approximations and residuals are updated by alternative recursion formulas in which groups of updates for the approximations and residuals are cumulated strategically. This is referred to as a strategy of group-wise update. On the other hand, the recursion formulas for updating the residuals of Bi-CR are different from those of Bi-CG. In this talk, we analyze the influence of rounding errors, which arise from the matrix--vector multiplications, on the convergence of Bi-CR. It is shown that the oscillation of some iteration vectors affects the convergence speed and the attainable accuracy. We also propose a variant of the group-wise updating strategy for improving the convergence of Bi-CR. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

Recently, we reconsidered the algorithms of some typical complex moment-based eigensolvers from the view point of projection methods, and map the relationships among these methods. From this analysis, we observed that the complex moment-based eigensolvers can be regarded as projection methods and can be categorized on their subspace, an orthogonal condition and a problem　to be applied implicitly. In this talk, we overview a Krylov subspace in the complex
moment-based eigensolvers.</p>

			<div id="abstract_Nakatsukasa" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p style="text-indent:1em">A common way of finding the poles of a meromorphic function \(f\), whose explicit expression is unknown but \(f(z)\) can be evaluated at any given \(z\), is to interpolate \(f\) by a rational function \(\frac{p}{q}\) such that \(r(\gamma_i)=f(\gamma_i)\) at prescribed sample points \(\{\gamma_i\}_{i=1}^L\), and then find the roots of \(q\). This is a two-step process and the type of the rational interpolant needs to be specified by the user. Many other algorithms for polefinding and rational interpolation (or least-squares fitting) have been proposed, but their numerical stability has remained largely uninvestigated. In this work we describe an algorithm with the following three features: (i) it automatically detects the appropriate type of the rational approximant, thereby allowing the user to input just the function \(f\), (ii) it finds the poles via a generalized eigenvalue problem of matrices constructed directly from the sampled values \(f(\gamma_i)\) in a one-step fashion, and (iii) it computes rational approximants \(\hat p,\hat q\) in a numerically stable manner, in that \((\hat p+\Delta p)/(\hat q+\Delta q)=f\) with small \(\Delta p,\Delta q\) at the sample points, making it the first rational interpolation (or approximation) algorithm with guaranteed numerical stability. Our algorithm allows for oversampling combined with a least-squares fitting, for which a key tool is rectangular eigenvalue problems. Experiments illustrate the resulting accuracy and stability, which can significantly outperform existing algorithms. This is joint work with Shinji Ito (NEC/U. Tokyo).</p>
