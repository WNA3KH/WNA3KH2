		Thispaper proposes a regularization method, combining the Tikhonov regularization in general form with the truncated GSVD.
		Then the randomized GSVD algorithms are adopted to implement the truncation process.
		This randomized GSVD for the regularization of the large-scale ill-posed problems can achieve good accuracy with less computational time and memory requirement than the classical regularization methods.
		Finally, we present the error analyses for the randomized algorithms.
		Some illustrative numerical examples are provided.</p>

		<div id="abstract_Mas" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p style="text-indent:1em">Iterative methods are a way to compute the least squares solution of a big overdetermined system of linear equations, especially when the coefficient matrix is also sparse. The use of a good preconditioner can speed up the convergence of the method, and in some cases, their use is necessary to get convergence. We propose to compute the preconditioner using a variant of the Balanced Incomplete Factorization algorithm that is breakdown free when the coefficient matrix has full rank. This preconditioner computes an incomplete LU factorization of the coefficient matrix of the normal equations using a criterion to annihilate entries based on the (incomplete) LU factorization of the inverse of the coefficient matrix.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:1em">We also discuss ways to update a given preconditioner using the same framework. If a set of new equations is added to the system or, on the contrary, a set of equation is deleted. This strategy permits to construct a new preconditioner from the previous one, in a way that is cheaper than to recalculate a preconditioner from the scratch.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:1em">We also present the results of the proposed methods on several test problems to assess their performance.</p>

A new normwise condition number for the TLS problem is introduced and SVD-based explicit formulae for the TLS condition number are derived. Our proposed condition estimation algorithms are efficient for the small and medium size TLS problem. Numerical examples illustrate the reliability of the algorithms. Both normwise and componentwise perturbations are considered. Moreover, structured condition estimations are investigated for the structured TLS problem.</p></div>

			<div id="abstract_Sogabe" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close">
		<p style="text-indent:1em">Complex symmetric (not Hermitian) linear systems arise in a rich variety of applications such as ondensed matter physics, electromagnetics, and acoustics.
		One of the best-known Krylov subspace methods is the COCG (conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient) method of van der Vorst and Melissen in 1990.
		Since the COCG method has irregular convergence behavior, the QMR-SYM method was proposed by Freund in 1992.
		In 2007, we focused on the CR (conjugate residual) method, and extended it to complex symmetric linear systems with short term recurrences relations.
		The resulting algorithm, referred to as the COCR method, is easy to implement as well as the COCG method, and tends to have smooth convergence behavior as well as the QMR-SYM method if the coefficient matrix is close to real symmetric.</p>
		<p style="text-indent:1em">In this talk, we give a brief overview of Krylov subspace methods for complex symmetric linear systems, and a recent progress of the COCG method in a direction of (generalized) shifted linear systems with multiple right-hand sides that also arise in condensed matter physics.
		In addition, I would like to talk about Professor Hayamiâ€™s interesting lecture on numerical analysis at the University of Tokyo when I was a graduate student.</p>

			<div id="abstract_Aihara" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p style="text-indent:1em">The Bi-Conjugate Gradient (Bi-CG) method and the Bi-Conjugate Residual (Bi-CR) method are the basic short-recurrence iterative methods for solving nonsymmetric linear systems. In finite precision arithmetic, the oscillation in the residual norms of the Bi-CG type methods is known to affect the convergence speed and the ultimately attainable accuracy of the approximate solutions. For reducing the influence of rounding errors, it has been proposed that the approximations and residuals are updated by alternative recursion formulas in which groups of updates for the approximations and residuals are cumulated strategically. This is referred to as a strategy of group-wise update. On the other hand, the recursion formulas for updating the residuals of Bi-CR are different from those of Bi-CG. In this talk, we analyze the influence of rounding errors, which arise from the matrix--vector multiplications, on the convergence of Bi-CR. It is shown that the oscillation of some iteration vectors affects the convergence speed and the attainable accuracy. We also propose a variant of the group-wise updating strategy for improving the convergence of Bi-CR. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

Recently, we reconsidered the algorithms of some typical complex moment-based eigensolvers from the view point of projection methods, and map the relationships among these methods. From this analysis, we observed that the complex moment-based eigensolvers can be regarded as projection methods and can be categorized on their subspace, an orthogonal condition and a problem
to be applied implicitly. In this talk, we overview a Krylov subspace in the complex
moment-based eigensolvers.</p>

    <div id="abstract_Nakatsukasa" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p style="text-indent:1em">A common way of finding the poles of a meromorphic function \(f\), whose explicit expression is unknown but \(f(z)\) can be evaluated at any given \(z\), is to interpolate \(f\) by a rational function \(\frac{p}{q}\) such that \(r(\gamma_i)=f(\gamma_i)\) at prescribed sample points \(\{\gamma_i\}_{i=1}^L\), and then find the roots of \(q\). This is a two-step process and the type of the rational interpolant needs to be specified by the user. Many other algorithms for polefinding and rational interpolation (or least-squares fitting) have been proposed, but their numerical stability has remained largely uninvestigated. In this work we describe an algorithm with the following three features: (i) it automatically detects the appropriate type of the rational approximant, thereby allowing the user to input just the function \(f\), (ii) it finds the poles via a generalized eigenvalue problem of matrices constructed directly from the sampled values \(f(\gamma_i)\) in a one-step fashion, and (iii) it computes rational approximants \(\hat p,\hat q\) in a numerically stable manner, in that \((\hat p+\Delta p)/(\hat q+\Delta q)=f\) with small \(\Delta p,\Delta q\) at the sample points, making it the first rational interpolation (or approximation) algorithm with guaranteed numerical stability. Our algorithm allows for oversampling combined with a least-squares fitting, for which a key tool is rectangular eigenvalue problems. Experiments illustrate the resulting accuracy and stability, which can significantly outperform existing algorithms. This is joint work with Shinji Ito (NEC/U. Tokyo).</p>

			New algorithms are developped for computing the matrix-vector products \(\mathbf{v} \mapsto J \mathbf{v}\) and \(\mathbf{w} \mapsto J^T \mathbf{w}\), where \(J\) denotes the derivative of \(u(t, \mathbf{c}) = \exp(t A(\mathbf{c})) \mathbf{b}\) with respect to \(\mathbf{c}\).
			Problems of this type arise in the context of parameter identification problems.
			Here, \(A\) is usually very large and sparse, i.e., none of the large, but dense matrices, \(\exp(tA)\) or \(J\), can be computed explicitly or stored.

  <div id="abstract_Tsuchiya" style="display: none;position:relative;margin-left:15pt" class="close"><p style="text-indent:1em">Semidefinite programming is a surprising analogue of classical linear programming in the space of symmetric positive semidefinite marices. Interior-point method (IPM) is the only generic and powerful algorithm for in solving semidefinite programming problems (SDP). But in theory, IPM is only applicable to &quot;regular problems&quot; such that positive definite feasible solutions exist on both primal and dual sides. The main objective of this talk to show in detail how one can use interior-point methods to solve an arbitrary SDP completely. Here, we use the term to completely solve an SDP to mean a scheme which works in the following way: given an SDP, the scheme checks whether it is feasible or not, and whenever feasible, computes its optimal value, and if the optimal value is attained, obtains a maximal rank optimal solution. If the optimal value is not attained, computes a feasible solution whose objective value is arbitrarily close to the optimal value. Moreover, if the original SDP is infeasible, it distinguishes between strong and weak infeasibility, and in the case of weak infeasibility, can compute a point in the corresponding affine space whose distance to the positive semidefinite cone is less than an arbitrary small given positive number.  This is a joint work with Lourenco F. Bruno (Tokyo Institute of Technology) and Masakazu Muramatsu (The University of Electro-Communications).</p></div>

			Numerical experiments further confirm that the new preconditioner is efficient. We also find that the IGO preconditioned BA-GMRES method is superior to the corresponding CGLS method for ill-conditioned and singular least-squares problems.</p>
