<h2>About Professor Ken Hayami</h2>

<div style="width:800px">
<p style="text-indent:1em">Ken Hayami obtained Master Degree in 1981 from the University of Tokyo and began his career as a researcher at the research laboratories of NEC Corporation. He was a research manager in NEC from 1991 to 1993. Meanwhile, he obtained Doctor of Philosophy Degrees from the Wessex Institute of Technology (1991) and the University of Tokyo (1993), respectively. In 1993, Hayami became an associate professor at the Department of Mathematical Engineering and Information Physics, Faculty of Engineering (1993-2000) and Graduate School of Engineering (1995-2000), at the University of Tokyo. After that, he became a professor in Mathematical Informatics at the National Institute of Informatics (NII) (2001-2006) and the Department of Informatics at SOKENDAI (The Graduate University of Advanced Studies) (2002-2004), respectively. He was the head of the Department of Informatics at SOKENDAI from 2006 to 2008. Currently, he is a professor in the Principles of Informatics Research Division of NII and the Department of Informatics at SOKENDAI.</p>
<p style="text-indent:1em">As a student, Hayami started research on fluid dynamics and plasticity. At NEC, he worked on prediction of routability of LSI, preconditioned conjugate gradient methods for vector processors, numerical integration of nearly singular integrals arising in the boundary element method (BEM). Then he moved on to Fast Multipole Methods. For the past two decades, he is active and has concentrated his efforts on iterative solution of large sparse linear systems, especially on the convergence analysis of Krylov subspace methods for singular system, iterative solution of least squares problems and inverse problems. Hayami has published 24 journal papers, one book in Springer-Verlag and has presented over 130 conference talks home and abroad including over 30 invited talks. Hayami has served on the editorial boards of many journals, including Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Numerical Algorithms, JSIAM Letters etc. </p>
<p style="text-indent:1em">Hayami has supervised a wonderful group of graduate students including Jun-Feng Yin (Tongji University), who received The Applied Numerical Algebra Prize 2010; Yasunori Aoki (Uppsala University), who received 2015 Best Author Prize of the Japan Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (JSIAM) and Best Poster in AC.CES Conference; and Keiichi Morikuni (University of Tsukuba), who received Nagakura Research Incentive Award in SOKENDAI, NII Best Student Award, SIAM Student Paper Prize (2013), and 31st Inoue Research Award for Young Scientists (2015).</p>
<p style="text-indent:1em">On the occasion of Ken Hayamiâ€™s sixtieth birthday, his students, and many colleagues and friends will participate in a workshop held at the National Institute of Informatics on January 11-12, 2016.</p>
